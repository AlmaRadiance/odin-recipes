## Project Overview

The project is organized as follows:

- The main index page (`index.html`) introduces the website and provides links to various recipe pages.
- Individual recipe pages are stored in the `recipes` directory, each with a unique HTML file name.
- Recipe pages follow a consistent structure, including an image of the dish, description, ingredients list, and steps list.

## Project Steps

1. **GitHub Repository Setup:**
   - Created a public GitHub repository named "odin-recipes" to showcase the project.
   - Managed version control using Git, following best practices for commits and branching.

2. **Main Index Page:**
   - Developed the main page (`index.html`) with an h1 heading "SunnySide Greens Corner" to introduce the project.
   - Included links to multiple recipe pages using HTML anchor tags.

3. **Recipe Pages:**
   - Created a `recipes` directory to store individual recipe pages.
   - Designed separate HTML files for each recipe, following the naming convention.
   - Constructed recipe pages with consistent structure: recipe name as h1 heading, image of the dish, description, ingredients list, and steps list.

4. **Content Creation:**
   - Sourced relevant images of the dishes to provide visual representation.
   - Crafted clear and concise descriptions of the recipes.
   - Listed ingredients and steps in an organized manner using HTML lists.

5. **Additional Recipes:**
   - Expanded the project by adding multiple recipes, maintaining a uniform page structure.
   - Organized recipe links in an unordered list for improved readability.

6. **GitHub Pages Deployment:**
   - Utilized GitHub Pages to publish the project on the web.
   - Set up the main HTML file as "index.html" to enable easy web access.
 

## Skills Demonstrated

- Proficiency in HTML, including structuring pages and creating hyperlinks.
- Version control using Git and GitHub.
- Basic web development project organization and deployment.

This project is a fundamental step in my journey to becoming a proficient web developer. I look forward to enhancing the website's aesthetics through CSS styling in the future.
