    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Heat grill to medium-high. Season chicken with coriander, oregano, salt, and pepper. Grill, covered, turning halfway through, until slightly charred and the thickest part of the breast registers 165ÂºF when probed with a thermometer, 18 to 22 minutes. Let rest for another 5 minutes, then slice.</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Meanwhile, make dressing. Whisk olive oil, red wine vinegar, and parsley in a small bowl and season with salt and pepper.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Divide lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, avocado, feta, and olives among four serving bowls. Top with sliced chicken, then drizzle with dressing.
