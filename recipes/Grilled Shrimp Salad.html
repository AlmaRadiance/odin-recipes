        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 1</h3>
                    <p>In a bowl, combine the olive oil, minced garlic, paprika, salt, black pepper, and lemon juice to create a marinade.
                        Add the peeled and deveined shrimp to the marinade, tossing to coat. Let the shrimp marinate for about 15-20 minutes.
                        Preheat the grill to medium-high heat. Thread the shrimp onto skewers if desired (for easier grilling).
                        Grill the shrimp for 2-3 minutes per side until they are pink and opaque. Remove from the grill and set aside.</p>
                <h3>Step 2</h3>
                    <p>In a large salad bowl, arrange the mixed salad greens as the base.
                        Add the halved cherry tomatoes, sliced cucumber, thinly sliced red onion, crumbled feta cheese, and chopped fresh herbs to the bowl.
                        </p>
                <h3>Step 3</h3>
                    <p>In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, Dijon mustard, minced garlic, salt, and pepper until well combined. Drizzle the tangy lemon dressing over the salad ingredients.
                        Carefully place the grilled shrimp on top of the salad. Once the grilled shrimp salad is assembled, it's ready to be served.
                        Serve the salad immediately to enjoy the warm grilled shrimp contrasted with the crisp vegetables and greens.
                        This salad is perfect for a light lunch, dinner, or as a refreshing appetizer.
