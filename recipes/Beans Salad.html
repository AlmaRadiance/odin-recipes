        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 1</h3>
                    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the thawed edamame, drained chickpeas, drained black beans, and corn kernels. Add the diced red bell pepper, diced cucumber, finely chopped red onion, and fresh cilantro to the bowl with the beans, edamame, and chickpeas.
                        Gently toss the ingredients to create a balanced mixture.
                        
                    </p>
                <h3>Step 2</h3>
                    <p>In a separate small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, honey or maple syrup, minced garlic, ground cumin, salt, and pepper. Mix until well combined. Drizzle the tangy dressing over the bean, edamame, and vegetable mixture.
                        Gently toss the salad to ensure all the ingredients are coated with the dressing.
                         </p>
                <h3>Step 3</h3>
                    <p>Once the edamame, chickpea, and bean salad is well-mixed and dressed, it's ready to be served.
                        Allow the salad to rest for a short while before serving to allow the flavors to meld together.
                        Serve the salad as a hearty and nutritious meal on its own, or pair it with whole grains for added sustenance.</p>
